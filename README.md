linkypedia
==========

linkypedia is a webapp for seeing how 3rd party web content is being used on 
wikipedia.

This version has additional scripts by Ed Baker (http://ebaker.me.uk)
to provide additional ways of interpreting links to a domain from Wikipedia.
This work is being done to provide some metrics for analysing how an
organisation can monitor it's Wikipedia impact over timeÂ·
